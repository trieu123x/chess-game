   * Measured in the Settings dialog, which is `aria-modal`: 25 elements the
   * browser will tab to against 23 the trap matched, and one of the two it
   * missed -- "Advanced engine options" -- sat *after* the last one it knew
   * about. So the wrap fired at the wrong element and never covered it.
   * Expand the advanced options, collapse them again (a click leaves focus on
   * the summary it toggled) and press Tab: focus was on `<body>`, outside a
   * dialog the rest of the page is hidden behind, with only Shift+Tab to get
   * back. Reached by clicking, which is how a disclosure is used, so a plain
   * Tab sweep of the dialog never found it.
   *
   * `isFocusable` below still does the deciding: a second `<summary>` in the
   * same `<details>` is not the disclosure and reports `tabIndex === -1`,
   * which it already rejects.

     * one browser's convention on another inside a dialog and nowhere else,

     * that lands outside the panel goes to the end it was heading for.

     * backdrop closes it, and this is torn down before the close hands focus
     * back to whatever opened it.
