 * before the opponent has played, and waiting for them costs the seconds the
 * game is decided by. Now that Play mode has a clock, this is the other half of
 * being able to play a fast game here at all.
 *
 * A premove cannot be checked for legality when it is made — the position it
 * will be played into does not exist yet. So the rule is deliberately loose on
 * the way in (is that your piece?) and strict on the way out (does chess.js
 * take it?), and anything that does not fit the position that arrives is
 * dropped without comment. That is what every board that has premoves does; the
 * alternative is refusing moves that would have been legal.
