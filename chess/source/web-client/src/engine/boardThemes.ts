 * notation ink chosen against it. That ink is the reason this is a module
 * rather than two more strings in `App.tsx`: coordinates are drawn *inside* the
 * squares, so every scheme needs its own ink, and picking one by eye is how a
 * board ends up with coordinates nobody can read on the dark squares.
 *
 * The rule every scheme here meets: the ink clears **WCAG AA (4.5:1) against
 * the darker square**, which is the worse of the two, and is no worse than the
 * original pair's ink, which measures 4.9995 — the comment it came from said
 * "5:1", rounded. The usual "opposite square colour" convention cannot reach
 * even AA against a mid-tone dark square, no lightness of white does, so each
 * ink is instead the scheme's own dark square taken down toward black until it
 * clears the bar, which keeps it in the scheme's hue.
 *
 * `boardThemes.test.ts` computes the ratios rather than trusting these values,
 * so a scheme cannot be added below either bar.

/**
 * How solid a move hint is drawn.
 *
 * The hints used to be one hardcoded pair for all five schemes — a 25% black
 * dot for a quiet move and a half-opacity orange disc for a capture. Measured
 * against the squares they are drawn on, the dot came out between 1.6:1 and
 * 1.8:1 and the capture disc between 1.01:1 and 1.16:1 on the dark squares, so
 * neither cleared the bar on any scheme. Same defect the coordinates had, and
 * for the same reason — one value picked by eye against one board — one layer
 * further down, where the contrast sweep cannot see it because a square has no
 * text in it to measure.
 *
 * What that ratio does *not* mean, and it is worth writing down because the
 * number invites the wrong conclusion: the orange disc was not invisible. It
 * failed a luminance criterion while carrying its difference in hue, and
 * `colorVision.distanceAsSeen` puts it 24 to 57 ΔE from its square even
 * simulated for protanopia — plainly visible, to everyone. The quiet dot is the
 * one that was genuinely faint, at 13.5 to 16.9 ΔE.
 *
 * So the case for changing them is not that they could not be seen. It is that
 * a hint should not depend on hue to be seen at all, that the orange was close
 * to the amber this board already spends on "the move that was played", and
 * that five schemes sharing two values picked against one of them is how the
 * coordinates went wrong. The pair below clears 3:1 on every scheme *and* sits
 * 33 to 36 ΔE from its square.
 *
 * The hint reuses the scheme's own `ink` rather than adding a sixth pair of
 * hand-picked colours: it is the one colour per scheme already proven to clear
 * AA against the *darker* square, which is the harder of the two, so at this
 * alpha it clears the graphical bar against both. 0.72 is the lowest round
 * value that does it for every scheme; the tests compute that rather than
 * trust it.
