/**

 * Nothing here reads the wall clock: every function that needs the time takes
 * `now`. That is what makes a clock testable at all — the alternative is a
 * module that can only be exercised by waiting, and a flag that can only be
 * reproduced by sitting through five minutes.
 *
 * The bank is what a side has *committed*: it changes only when a move is made
 * or the clock is paused. What is displayed is the bank minus however long the
 * running side has been thinking, computed on read. So a ticking display costs
 * no state changes, which is the reason `<ChessClock />` can re-render ten times
 * a second without the rest of the app doing the same.
